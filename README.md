### About me 
Hey there! I am David Lucas, 24 years old, living in Brazil.

I am a Technologist in Computer Networks from "IFPB - Instituto Federal da Paraíba" in 2021. I'm currently working as a mobile developer using React Native, but also I have experience using ReactJS for web applications. Also I love to work for user interface design.

I started my own website so I could share a few things that I am working with, you can visit: https://davidev.com.br/

⚡ Fun fact: I am crazy about Aviation.

### Technologies
* Frontend Development with HTML, CSS (SASS and Styled Component as well), JavaScript, React, NextJS and AngularJS.
* Mobile Development with React Native - I am currently studying Java to start to develop using native tools.
* User Interface Design.
